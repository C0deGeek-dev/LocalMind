LocalMind is a local-first learning layer for AI-assisted development. It imports
opted-in sessions, removes likely secrets, extracts candidate lessons, asks a
human to review them, and stores accepted knowledge as readable project files.

| At a glance | |
|---|---|
| **Use it when** | Your agent keeps rediscovering the same fixes, decisions, and project conventions |
| **It remembers** | Only lessons you explicitly accept or edit |
| **It stores** | Readable Markdown memory plus a local SQLite audit/search index |
| **It connects to** | LocalPilot natively; generic, Claude Code, and OpenAI Codex transcripts through the CLI |
| **Cloud required** | No |

## Privacy by design

LocalMind keeps the knowledge extracted from your work under your control.

- **No usage telemetry is sent.** Sessions, candidate lessons, searches, and
  memory activity are not reported to LocalX or an analytics service.
- **Memory stays local.** Accepted knowledge is stored as readable Markdown and
  a local SQLite index in paths you control.
- **Learning is opt-in per project.** A repo with no `.localmind.toml` is never
  learned from; creating the file is the opt-in. Once enabled, accepted lessons
  write to both the project store **and** the same-machine global store by
  default (cross-project knowledge) — set `allowed_scopes = ["project"]` to keep
  a project's memory project-only. Nothing leaves the machine (`local_only`).
- **Inference is optional.** Deterministic local behavior works without a cloud
  service; any configured inference or embedding endpoint is an explicit choice.
- **Nothing becomes memory silently.** Secret redaction and human review happen
  before durable project knowledge is written.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> LocalMind is opt-in and review-gated. It refuses project memory writes until
> `.localmind.toml` enables learning, and it never promotes a candidate lesson
> automatically.

## Quick start

Build the CLI:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/C0deGeek-dev/LocalMind.git
cd LocalMind
cargo build -p localmind-cli
cargo run -p localmind-cli -- --help
```

Enable local-only learning in the project you want LocalMind to serve:

```toml
# .localmind.toml
[learning]
enabled = true
local_only = true
memory_root = ".localmind/memory"
allowed_scopes = ["project"]
excluded_paths = ["target/**", ".git/**"]
```

Import a transcript, close the session out, and inspect the review queue:

```sh
localmind import ./session.txt --project . --source open-ai-codex
localmind closeout <session-id> --project .
localmind review list --project .
```

Accept one durable lesson, then promote and find it:

```sh
localmind review accept <lesson-id> --project . --reviewer <your-name>
localmind promote <lesson-id> --project .
localmind search "deterministic fixtures" --project .
```

If you are running from the checkout instead of an installed binary, prefix a
command with `cargo run -p localmind-cli --`.

## The learning loop

```text
opted-in session
      │
      ▼
redact ──> summarize ──> candidate lessons ──> human review
                                                   │
                               accepted only ──────┘
                                      │
                                      ▼
                         Markdown memory + local index
                                      │
                                      ▼
                           context for a later session
```

The current extractor is deterministic: explicit `Lesson:` markers plus
heuristics for failure-and-resolution pairs, repeated commands, and user
corrections. `SessionExtractor` is the seam for future model-backed extraction;
cloud inference is not the default.

## Review is the safety boundary

| Command | What happens |
|---|---|
| `localmind review list` | Show pending candidates |
| `localmind review inspect <id>` | Read the evidence before deciding |
| `localmind review accept <id>` | Mark the lesson as durable enough to keep |
| `localmind review edit <id> "…"` | Correct the lesson before accepting it |
| `localmind review reject <id>` | Reject it, optionally with a note |
| `localmind review defer <id>` | Leave it for later |
| `localmind promote <id>` | Write an accepted lesson to project memory |
| `localmind audit` | Inspect the local decision history |

Promotion writes readable Markdown below `.localmind/memory/project/`, updates
the local search and relationship index, and records an audit event in
`.localmind/localmind.sqlite`.

## What gets written

An imported session receives a deterministic folder under
`.localmind/sessions/<session-id>/`:

```text
transcript.redacted.txt
metadata.json
summary.json
candidates.json
```

Likely API keys, bearer tokens, token/password assignments, connection-string
passwords, private keys, and configured sensitive paths are redacted before the
transcript is persisted.

## Context and skill drafts

Accepted memory can be packaged for different agent hosts:

```sh
localmind context export "release checklist" --target localpilot --project .
localmind context export "deterministic fixtures" --target open-ai-codex --project .
```

Repeated workflows can become disabled `SKILL.md` drafts:

```sh
localmind skills generate --project .
localmind skills list --project .
localmind skills inspect <skill-id> --project .
localmind skills export <skill-id> --project .
```

LocalMind never installs or activates a generated skill by itself.

## Evidence so far

In the controlled `localbench-uplift-v1` evaluation, injecting accepted lessons
lifted a deliberately headroom-rich held-out suite from **0% to 100%**. The
effect held on a second local model. This is evidence that reviewed memory can
change outcomes, not a claim that every task becomes solvable.

## Architecture for host authors

The learning engine is split into host-neutral Rust crates. LocalPilot embeds it
through an adapter; the core never depends on LocalPilot. The standalone CLI
uses the same contracts for generic transcripts and other agent hosts.

### What the standalone `localmind` CLI exposes

Several engine capabilities are **implemented and tested in the crates but
mounted by a host** (LocalPilot), not surfaced by this binary. Know which you get
from the CLI alone:

| Capability | Standalone `localmind` CLI | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Import → closeout → review → promote → search (FTS5) → audit → context export | ✅ | The core loop |
| Signed memory bundle export/import, `eval`, `status`, skill drafts | ✅ | |
| Batch `insights` (distill/research) | ✅ (needs `[inference]`) | Model-backed; skipped with a notice when no endpoint |
| Hybrid keyword+vector search, rerank | host-mounted | Engine has it; the CLI search is keyword (FTS5) only |
| Code graph (ingest/query/impact/primer), MCP graph tools | host-mounted | No CLI subcommand drives these |
| Freshness pass, usage stats, provenance, source revalidation, memory delete | host-mounted | Exposed by the LocalPilot `learning`/`memory` commands |

The `[retrieval] rerank` config keys are accepted and validated but only take
effect through a host that runs the rerank stage.

**`local_only` note.** `local_only = true` is mandatory (setting it `false` is a
typed error), but it constrains *scope* (memory is same-machine), not the
`[inference]`/`[embedding]` URLs — those accept any reachable `http(s)` endpoint.
Keep the endpoints on loopback/your LAN if you want inference to stay on-machine;
the standalone engine does not enforce a loopback-only inference host.

The local gate mirrors CI:

```sh
cargo fmt --check
cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -- -D warnings
cargo test --workspace
cargo check --workspace
cargo run -p localmind-cli -- --help
```

CI aliases live in `.cargo/config.toml`: `cargo ci-fmt`, `cargo ci-lint`,
`cargo ci-test`, and `cargo ci-doctest`. `localmind eval` runs the memory-quality
regression suite and can emit JSON with `--json`.
